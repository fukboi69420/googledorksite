A simple Site for automated google dorking techniques

The internet has become an integral part of our daily lives, connecting us to information, entertainment, and each other. However,
not all websites are accessible to everyone, as some may be blocked or deprecated. This can be frustrating for users who rely on certain websites, 
particularly those that utilize online P2P servers

Online P2P servers, or peer-to-peer servers, are a popular way for users to share files and data with each other. However, due to various legal and 
regulatory concerns, some websites that rely on P2P servers have been blocked or deprecated by internet service providers. This means that users may not
be able to access these websites or use their P2P servers to share files

Despite these limitations, most websites should still work for users. While P2P servers may be blocked or deprecated, many websites still operate using
traditional client-server models. This means that users can still access and use the website's content and features without relying on P2P servers.

However, the limitations on P2P servers can be a significant obstacle for users who rely on these servers to share files or communicate with others.
For example, online gaming communities may rely on P2P servers to connect players together, and the limitations on these servers may impact the ability
of players to connect and play together.

Furthermore, the limitations on P2P servers can have broader implications for internet freedom and access to information.
By limiting access to certain websites and servers, internet service providers may impact the ability of users to share information and communicate
with each other. This can be particularly concerning in countries where internet access is heavily regulated or censored.

In conclusion, the limitations on P2P servers can be frustrating for users who rely on these servers to share files and communicate with others.
However, most websites should still be accessible to users, even if P2P servers are blocked or deprecated. The broader implications of these limitations on
internet freedom and access to information should also be considered, as they may impact the ability of users to communicate and share information online.

# Usage

to use any of the premade htm files is easy,
open htm file and it will open a static site "hosted"
from where it is on your computer (the "url" should be the 
file path of what you opened)

Any .Note files are just premade templates for certain
functions and uses and you can copy them if you wanna add
something to your "site" files.
